# Sample Python Flask App

This _very_ simple Python Flask app simply displays information about the container, the client accessing the container, and the request that was made to the container. It was intended to be used as a demonstration of multi-container applications leveraging a reverse proxy.

This app is heavily inspired by and based upon the following examples:

* [yfauser/sample-flask-container](https://github.com/yfauser/sample-flask-container)
* [sjeeva/flaskapp](https://github.com/sjeeva/flaskapp)
